\section{The Different Covariates Setting}\label{sec_diff}

When the covariates across tasks are different, we can no longer obtain an optimal solution for minimizing equation \eqref{eq_mtl} as in Claim \ref{lem_exp_opt}.
This is because the minimization problem is non-convex with respect to $A$ and $B$.
Therefore, we consider an arbitrary local minimum of equation \eqref{eq_mtl} and provide generalization bounds that scale with key properties of task data such as sample sizes and covariate shifts.
We focus on the two-task case to better understand the impact of having different sample sizes and different covariates in hard parameter sharing.
We will develop the key technical results in this section, and describe their implications in the next section.

We first provide a key technical tool that we derived using recent developments in random matrix theory \cite{??}.
To motivate our study, we consider a specialized setting where the output layer weights $A_1, A_2$ are both equal to one.
Without loss of generality, we consider the prediction loss of hard parameter sharing for task two and the same analysis applies to task one.
By solving $B$ in equation \eqref{eq_mtl}, we obtain the hard parameter sharing estimator $\hat{\beta}_2^{\MTL} = B A_2 = B$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\hat{\beta}_2^{\MTL} = {\hat{\Sigma}}^{-1} ({X^{(1)}}^{\top} Y^{(1)} + {X^{(2)}}^{\top} Y^{(2)}), \text{ where } \hat{\Sigma} = {X^{(1)}}^{\top} X^{(1)} + {X^{(2)}}^{\top} X^{(2)}.
\end{align*}
For the prediction loss, the empirical loss is close to the expected loss similar to what we have shown in Claim \ref{claim_pred_err}.
Hence, we consider the expected loss conditional on the covariates as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eq_diff_cov}
	\exarg{\cE}{L(\hat{\beta}_2^{\MTL}) \mid X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}} =
	\bignorm{(\Sigma^{(2)})^{1/2} \hat{\Sigma}^{-1} {X^{(1)}}^{\top} X^{(1)} (\beta^{(1)} - \beta^{(2)})}^2
	+ \sigma^2 \bigtr{\Sigma^{(2)}\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}}.
\end{align}

Interestingly, the prediction loss admits a bias-variance decomposition similar to the same covariates setting.
The variance equation scales with the sample covariance matrice of both tsks, whereas the bias equation scales additionally with the distance between the beta vectors.
In both the bias and variance equations, the matrix inverse $\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}$ is a crucial quantity.
Intuitively, this matrix inverse combines the sample covariance matrix of both tasks, and it is not hard to see that the expectation of $\hat{\Sigma}$ is equal to a mixture of their population covariance matrices, with mixing proportions determined by the sample sizes.
However, since the two tasks have different covariates, the scaling of $\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}$ not only depends on the tasks' sample sizes, but also depends on the covariate shift between the two tasks.
Building on the intuition, We introduce a key result that shows tight asymptotic convergence rate of the bias and variance as $p$ goes to infinity.
We define a key quantity $M \define \Sigma_1^{1/2}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}$ that captures the covariate shift between task $1$ and task $2$.
Let $U\Lambda V^\top$ denote the singular value decomposition of $M$, where $\Lambda\in\real^{p\times p}$ consists of $M$'s singular values $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_p$ as its diagonal entries in descending order.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_main_RMT}
	Suppose that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are both random matrices that satisfy Assumption \ref{assume_rm}.
	With high probability over the randomness of $X_1$ and $X_2$, we have the following limits:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[i)]  The variance equation converges to the following asymptotic limit
			\begin{align}\label{lem_cov_shift_eq}
				\bigabs{\bigtr{\Sigma^{(2)} \bigbrace{(n_1 + n_2){\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}} - (a_1 \Sigma^{(1)} + a_2 \Sigma^{(2)})^{-1}}}} \lesssim p^{-c_{\varphi}}\norm{\Sigma^{(2)}},
			\end{align}
			where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the solutions of the following two equations:
			\begin{align}
				a_1 + a_2 = 1- \frac{1}{\rho_1 + \rho_2},\quad a_1 + \frac1{\rho_1 + \rho_2}\cdot \bigbrace{\frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^p \frac{\lambda_i^2 a_1}{\lambda_i^2 a_1 + a_2}} = \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_1 + \rho_2}. \label{eq_a12extra}
			\end{align}
		\item[ii)] For any fixed vector $w\in\real^p$ with unit norm, the bias equation converges to the following asymptotic limit
			\begin{align}\label{lem_cov_derv_eq}
				\bigabs{w^{\top} \Sigma^{(1)} \bigbrace{(n_1+n_2)^2\hat{\Sigma}^{-1} \Sigma^{(2)} \hat{\Sigma}^{-1} - {\Sigma^{(2)}}^{-1/2} V {\frac{a_3 \Lambda^2 + (a_4 + 1)\id}{(a_1 \Lambda + a_2\id)^2}} V^{\top} {\Sigma^{(2)}}^{-1/2}} \Sigma^{(1)} w} \lesssim p^{-c_{\varphi}},
			\end{align}
				where $a_{3}$ and $a_4$ are the solutions of the following two equations with $b_k = \frac1{p}\sum_{i=1}^p \frac{\lambda_i^{2k}} {(\lambda_i^2 a_1 + a_2)^2}$, for $k = 0, 1, 2$:
			\begin{align}\label{eq_a34extra}
				\left(\frac{\rho_1}{a_1^{2}} -  b_2  \right)\cdot  a_3 -  b_1 \cdot  a_4 = b_1,\quad \left(\frac{\rho_2}{a_2^{2}}-  b_0\right)\cdot  a_4 - b_1 \cdot  a_3
				= b_0.
			\end{align}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\noindent{\textbf{Remark.}} Our result extends a well-known result on the inverse of sample covariance matrices.
In particular, by setting $X_1 = 0$, we obtain the second result in Fact \ref{lem_minv}.
When $X_1=0$, it is not hard to solve $a_1 = 0$ and $a_2 = (n_2-p) / n_2$ from equation \eqref{eq_a12extra}, and our result reduces to the case of a single sample covariance matrix.
For the single-task case of a multivariate Gaussian random matrix, the result follows from the classical result for the mean of inverse Wishart distribution \cite{anderson1958introduction}.
For a non-Gaussian random matrix, the result can be obtained using the Stieltjes transform method (cf. Lemma 3.11 of \citet{bai2009spectral}).

By combining the bias and variance asymptotics, we obtain the generalization error of $\hat{\beta}_2^{\MTL}$.
Since the proof is similar to the same covariates setting, we describe the key differences and omit the rest of the details.
First, we will rescale $X_1$ by $A_1 / A_2$ before appling Theorem \ref{thm_main_RMT}.
Second, we approximate ${X^{(1)}}^{\top}X^{(1)}$ with $n_1 \Sigma^{(1)}$ in equation \eqref{eq_diff_cov} using Fact \ref{lem_minv}.
For the rest of this section, we the main ideas in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm_main_RMT}.
%We will give a simple (although not totally rigorous) derivation of the equations \eqref{eq_a12extra} and \eqref{eq_a34extra}.
The full proof can be found in Section \ref{sec_maintools}.

\paragraph{Proof overview.} The central quantify of interest is the matrix inverse $\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}$.
To study this quantity, we use the Stieltjes transform or the resolvent method in random matrix theory \cite{bai2009spectral,tao2012topics,erdos2017dynamical}.
%We give some preliminaries about this method before discussing the proof strategy.
For any probability measure $\mu$ supported on $[0,\infty)$, the Stieltjes transform of $\mu$ is given by
$$m_\mu(z):= \int_0^\infty \frac{\dd\mu(x)}{x-z},\quad z\in \C\setminus [0,\infty).$$
Conversely, given a Stieltjes transform $m_{\mu}(z)$, we can recover the measure $\mu$ through the inverse formula \HZ{add a ref to the equation below}
$$ \frac{\dd \mu(x)}{\dd x} = \frac{1}{\pi}\lim_{\eta \downarrow 0}\im m_{\mu}(x+\ii \eta).$$
%where $\rho(x)$ is the density for $\mu$, i.e. $\dd \mu(x)=\rho(x)\dd x$.
Hence the Stieltjes transform method reduces the study of a probability measure $\mu$ to the study of a complex function $m_\mu(z)$.
To study the matrix inverse $\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}$, we consider its empirical spectral distribution.
More precisely, since
\begin{align}\label{eigen2extra}
	\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}= \Sigma_2^{-1/2}V \frac{Y^{-1}}{n_1 + n_2} V^\top\Sigma_2^{-1/2}. \text{ where } Y \define \frac{1}{n_1 + n_2}(\Lambda U^\top (Z^{(1)})^\top Z^{(1)} U\Lambda  + V^\top (Z^{(2)})^\top Z^{(2)}V),
\end{align}
let $\mu=p^{-1}\sum_{i} \delta_{\lambda_i}$ denote the empirical spectral distribution of $Y$.
The scaling $(n_1+n_2)^{-1}$ ensures such that the support of $\mu$ is bounded.
The Stieltjes transform of the empirical spectral distribution $\mu$ is as follows
 \[ m_{\mu}(z) \define \frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^p \frac{1}{\sigma_i - z}= p^{-1}\tr\left[ (Y_p-z\id_p)^{-1}\right], \]
and when $p$ goes to infinity, $m_{\mu}(z)$ converges to a fixed-point governed by a set of self-consistent equations.
These self-consistent equations give the asymptotic limit of the trace of $\hat{\Sigma}^{-1}$.

The above approach applies when $\Sigma^{(2)}$ is isotropic in Theorem \ref{thm_main_RMT}.
For general covariances, we want to study the limit of $\tr\left[ (Y - z\id)^{-1}V^{\top}{\Sigma^{(2)}}^{-1}V \right]$ as shown in equation \eqref{eigen2extra}.
Hence, we study the resolvent matrix or Green's function $(Y-z\id)^{-1}$.
Compared to the Stieltjes transform, the resolvent also applies to random matrices.
The convergence of resolvent is formally shown using the so-called ``local laws'' (cf. \cite{isotropic,erdos2017dynamical,Anisotropic}) or ``deterministic equivalents'' (cf. \cite{Hachem2007deterministic,DS18}).
More precisely, given a deterministic $p\times p$ matrix $R(z)$, we say that $R(Z)$ and $(Y-z\id)^{-1}$ are equivalent if for any sequence of deterministic matrices $B$ of uniformly bounded operator norms,
$$\bigtr{((Y-z\id)^{-1}-R(z))B}\to 0.$$
If the above equation holds for all $p$, then we say that $(Y-z\id)^{-1}$ has a matrix limit $R(z)$.
For our result, we shall prove the convergence of the resolvent $(Y-z\id)^{-1}$ using ``local laws'' with a sharp convergence rate.

%For our purpose, we use a convenient linearization trick in linear algebra, that is, the SVD of a rectangular matrix $A$ is equivalent to the study of the eigendecomposition of the symmetric block matrix
%$$H(A):=\begin{pmatrix}0 & A \\ A^\top & 0\end{pmatrix},$$
%which is linear in $A$. This trick has been used in many random matrix literatures, such as \cite{Anisotropic, AEK_Gram, XYY_circular,DY20201}.
For the matrix $Y$ that we want to study, we can also write $Y = A A^{\top}$, where $A = [\Lambda U^\top (Z^{(1)})^\top,V^\top (Z^{(2)})^\top] \in \real^{p\times {n_1 + n_2}}$.
%}\HZ{what does this trick mean? use less technical words},
%This idea dates back at least to Girko, see e.g., the works \cite{girko1975random,girko1985spectral} and references therein.
Consider the following $(p+n)\times (p+n)$ symmetric block matrix
%which is a linear function of $(Z^{(1)})$ and $(Z^{(2)})$:
%\begin{definition}[Linearizing block matrix]\label{def_linearHG}%definiton of the Green function
%We define the $(n+N)\times (n+N)$ block matrix
 \begin{equation}\label{linearize_block}
    H \define (n_1 + n_2)^{-1/2}\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   { 0 } & \Lambda U^{\top}(Z^{(1)})^\top & V^\top (Z^{(2)})^\top  \\
   {Z^{(1)} U\Lambda  } & {0} & 0 \\
   {Z^{(2)}V} & 0 & 0
   \end{array}} \right).
 \end{equation}
The resolvent of $H$ is defined as follows.
\begin{definition}[Resolvents]
We define the resolvent or Green's function of $H$ as
 $G(z) \define (H - z\id_{p + n_1 + n_2})^{-1}$, for any complex value $z\in \mathbb C$.  %\left[H -\left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
%   { z\id_{p}} & 0 & 0 \\
%   0 & { \id_{n_1}}  & 0\\
%      0 & 0  & { \id_{n_2}}\\
%\end{array}} \right)\right]^{-1} , \quad z\in \mathbb C ,
%It is easy to verify that the eigenvalues $\lambda_1(H)\ge \ldots \ge \lambda_{n+N}(H)$ of $H$ are related to the ones of $\mathcal Q_1$ through
%\begin{equation}\label{Heigen}
%\lambda_i(H)=-\lambda_{n+N-i+1}(H)=\sqrt{\lambda_i\left(\mathcal Q_2\right)}, \ \ 1\le i \le n\wedge N, \quad \text{and}\quad \lambda_i(H)=0, \ \ n\wedge N + 1 \le i \le n\vee N.
%\end{equation}
%and
%$$\lambda_i(H)=0, \ \ n\wedge N + 1 \le i \le n\vee N.$$
%where we used the notations $n\wedge N:=\min\{N,M\}$ and $n\vee N:=\max\{N,M\}$.
%\begin{definition}[Index sets]\label{def_index}
Similarly, the resolvent of $Y$ is defined as $\cal G(z):=(Y - z\id_{p})^{-1}$, for any $z\in \mathbb C$.
\end{definition}

Using the Schur complement formula, we have that %\HZ{Has $G(z)$ been defined before?}
 \begin{equation} \label{green2}
  G(z) =  \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
   { \cal G (z)} & \cal G(z)A  \\
   A^\top \cal G(z) & z (A^\top A - z)^{-1}
\end{array}} \right)^{-1}, %\quad \cal G_R:=(W^\top W - z)^{-1} ,
 \end{equation}
This shows that a control of $G(z)$ yields directly a control of $\mathcal G(z)$ as the upper-left block. On the other hand, $G(z)$ is a little  easier to use than $\cal G(z)$, and obviously contains more information.

\noindent\textbf{Asymptotic limits of resolvents.}
We now describe the asymptotic limit of $G(z)$ as $n\to \infty$. First we define the deterministic limits of $(m_1(z), m_{2}(z))$ by $\left(-\frac{\rho_1+\rho_2}{\rho_1}a_{1}(z),-\frac{\rho_1+\rho_2}{\rho_2}a_{2}(z)\right)$, where $(a_1(z), a_2(z))$ is
%\HZ{This $M_{1}, M_{2}$ notation is awkward; consider changing it to ${M}_1(z), {M}_2(z)$ (or  better, say $a_1(z), a_2(z)$? if they correspond to $a_1, a_2$ when $z=0$)},
the unique solution to the following system of equations
\begin{equation}\label{selfomega_a}
\begin{split}
& \frac{\rho_1}{a_{1}(z)} = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^p \frac{\lambda_i^2}{ - z+\lambda_i^2 a_{1}(z) +a_{2} (z) } + (\rho_1+\rho_2),\  \frac{\rho_2}{a_{2}(z)} = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^p \frac{1 }{  -z+\lambda_i^2 a_{1}(z) +  a_{2}(z)  }+ (\rho_1+\rho_2) .
\end{split}
\ee
%satisfying that $\im a_{1}(z)< 0$ and $\im a_{2}(z)<0$ for $z\in \C_+$ with $\im z$.
The existence and uniqueness of the solution $(a_1(z), a_2(z))$ for $z$ around 0 will be proved in Section \ref{sec contract}.
%Here, for simplicity of notations, we introduced the following ratios
%\be\label{ratios}
% \gamma_n :=\frac{p}{n}=\frac{1}{\rho_1+\rho_2},\quad r_1 :=\frac{n_1}{n}=\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_1+\rho_2},\quad r_2 :=\frac{n_2}{n}=\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1+\rho_2}.
%\ee
We define the matrix limit of $G(z)$ as
\be \label{defn_piw}
\Gi(z) := \begin{pmatrix} (-z\id_p+a_{1}(z)\Lambda^2  +  a_{2}(z)\id_p)^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & - \frac{\rho_1+\rho_2}{\rho_1} a_{1}(z)\id_{n_1} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\frac{\rho_1+\rho_2}{\rho_2}a_{2}(z)\id_{n_2}  \end{pmatrix}.\ee
In particular, the matrix limit of $\cal G(z)$ is given by
\be\label{matrix limit}(-z\id_p+a_{1}(z)\Lambda^2 + a_{2}(z)\id_p)^{-1}.\ee

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Variance asymptotics.} Using definition \eqref{mainG}, we can write equation \eqref{eigen2extra} as
\be\label{rewrite X as R} [(X^{(1)})^\top X^{(1)}+(X^{(2)})^\top X^{(2)}]^{-1}=n^{-1}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}V\cal G(0)V^\top\Sigma_2^{-1/2}.\ee
When $z=0$, it is easy to check that equation \eqref{selfomega_a} can be reduced to equation \eqref{eq_a12extra}, which means that we actually have $a_1(0)=a_1$ and $a_2(0)=a_2$. Hence the matrix limit of $\cal G(0)$ is given by $(a_{1}\Lambda^2 + a_{2}\id_p)^{-1}$. Then inserting this limit into equation \eqref{rewrite X as R}, we can write the left-hand side of equation \eqref{lem_cov_shift_eq} as
\begin{align}
&\bigtr{\left( (X^{(1)})^{\top}X^{(1)} + (X^{(2)})^{\top}X^{(2)}\right)^{-1} \Sigma}\approx n^{-1}\bigtr{\Sigma_2^{-1/2}V\cal (a_{1}\Lambda^2 + a_{2}\id_p)^{-1}V^\top\Sigma_2^{-1/2}\Sigma}  \nonumber\\
&=n^{-1}\bigtr{\Sigma_2^{-1/2}\cal (a_{1}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}\Sigma_1\Sigma_2^{-1/2} + a_{2}\id_p)^{-1}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}\Sigma}  = n^{-1}\bigtr{\cal (a_{1} \Sigma_1  + a_{2}\Sigma_2)^{-1}\Sigma}  ,\label{Gi00}
\end{align}
where in the second step we used $V \Lambda^2 V^\top=M^\top M=\Sigma_2^{-1/2}\Sigma_1\Sigma_2^{-1/2}$ by equation \eqref{eigen2}.  This concludes equation \eqref{lem_cov_shift_eq} up to a small error. The rigorous proof of equation \eqref{lem_cov_shift_eq} will be given in Section \ref{sec pf RMTlemma}.
