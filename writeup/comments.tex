%Since all tasks share the same underlying model $\beta$, we use a simplified objective as follows.
%\begin{align}
%	\label{eq_mtl_basic}
%	f(w) = \sum_{i=1}^k \norm{X_i w - Y_i}^2.
%\end{align}
%{\bf The distributed learning problem.}
%    \begin{align}
%     f(w) = \sum_{i=1}^k \normFro{X_i w - Y_i}^2. \label{eq_dist}
%   \end{align}
%Equation \eqref{eq_mtl_basic} is simplified from equation \eqref{eq_mtl} by setting $A_i$ to be 1 for all tasks. %can select a model from the subspace of $B$ to fit $(X_i, Y_i)$.
