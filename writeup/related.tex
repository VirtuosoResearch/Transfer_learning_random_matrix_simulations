\section{Related Work}

\textbf{Multi-task learning.}
 Adding a regularization over $B$, e.g. \cite{LPTV09,LPVT11}.
Moreover, \cite{KD12} observed that controlling the capacity can outperform the implicit capacity control of adding regularization over $B$.


\textbf{Random matrix theory.}

\textbf{Transfer learning.}
