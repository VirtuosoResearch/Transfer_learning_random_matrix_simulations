\section{Introduction}

%Multi-task learning is an inductive learning mechanism to improve generalization performance using related task data.
%Many state-of-the-art results in computer vision and natural language processing are obtained using multi-task learning.
Multi-task learning represents a powerful paradigm to solve complex tasks in computer vision \cite{chexnet17,ZSSGM18}, natural language processing \cite{GLUE,superglue} and many other areas \cite{ZY17}.
%In multi-task learning, having related task data is fundamental to its performance.
%Multi-task learning is particularly powerful when there is limited labeled data for a task to be solved, meanwhile more labeled data from different but related tasks is available.
%By combining multiple information sources, it is possible to share all the information in the same model.
In many settings, multiple information sources are available to help solve a particular task.
%For example, many applications in , and many other areas have been achieved by learning from multiple tasks together.
The performance of multi-task learning depends on the relationship between the information sources and the task \cite{C97}.
When the information sources are heterogeneous, negative transfer--where multi-task learning (MTL)  performs worse than single-task learning (STL)--has often been observed \cite{PY09,AP16,BS17}.
While many empirical approaches are proposed to mitigate negative transfer \cite{ZY17}, a precise understanding of when negative transfer occurs remains elusive in the literature \cite{R17}.
%This phenomenon, known as \textit{negative transfer}, is fundamental to the understanding of multi-task learning.
In this work, we show that negative transfer is determined by the bias-variance tradeoff of multi-task learning estimators for the high-dimensional linear regression setting. % for learning from multiple linear regression tasks.
We develop new tools to analyze the tradeoff and explain negative transfer precisely.
%Inspired by the theory, we propose an incremental training schedule to improve multi-task training.
%We consider a setting where the target task has limited labeled data and show
%On the other hand, unless the structures across task data are well-understood, applying multi-task learning on several different datasets often result in suboptimal models (or negative transfer in more technical terms).

Understanding negative transfer requires developing tight generalization bounds for both multi-task learning and single-task learning.
In classical Rademacher or VC based theory of multi-task learning \cite{B00,AZ05,M06}, the generalization bounds are usually presented so that the error reduces as the data sizes of all tasks increase.
For instance, the data sizes of all tasks are often assumed to be equal \cite{B00,LPTV09,LPVT11,MPR16}.
On the other hand, uneven data sizes or dominating tasks have been empirically observed as a cause of negative transfer \cite{YKGLHF20}.
%The benefit of learning multi-task representations has also been studied for certain half-spaces \cite{} and sparse regression \cite{}.
When all tasks are sufficiently similar, it is known that adding more labeled data improves the generalization performance for predicting a particular task \cite{WZR20}.
To motivate our study, we describe simulation results for two linear regression tasks solved using a shared linear layer for both tasks and an output layer for each task.
In Figure \ref{fig_model_shift_phasetrans}, we observe that negative transfer occurs as (a) \textit{task similarity}: tasks become more different; (b) \textit{data size}: source/target data size increases.
%\textbf{Task similarity:}
%\textbf{Data sizes:}
%\textbf{Covariate shift:}
Furthermore, MTL performance is negatively affected when (c) \textit{covariate shift}: the covariance matrices of the two tasks become more different.
The observations highlight the need to develop generalization bounds that scale tightly with properties of the data in order to study MTL performance.

%\textbf{Setup and Main Results.}
We consider the high-dimensional linear regression setting \cite{HMRT19,BLLT20} to explain the above phenomena.
We focus on predicting a particular task that only contains limited amount of labeled data.
%Following Hastie et al.  and Bartlett et al. \cite{},
We assume that for every task $1\le i\le t$, its features are random vectors $x = \Sigma_i^{1/2}z$, where $z\in\real^p$ consists of i.i.d. entries with mean zero and unit variance, and $\Sigma_i\in\real^{p\times p}$ is a positive semidefinite matrix.
Let $n_i = \rho_i \cdot p$ denote the data size and $X_i\in\real^{n_i\times p}$ denote the features of task $i$.
The labels of task $i$ are given by $Y_i = X_i\beta_i + \varepsilon_i$, where $\beta_i\in\real^p$ denotes task $i$'s ground truth parameters and $\varepsilon_i$ denotes i.i.d. random noise with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$.
We focus on the hard parameter sharing architecture with a linear shared layer for all tasks and a separate prediction head for each task \cite{R17,MTDNN19,WZR20}.
%This corresponds to minimizing $ \sum_{i=1}^t \norm{X_i B W_i - Y_i}^2$.
Let $\hat{\beta}_t^{\MTL}$ denote the optimal multi-task estimator for the target task, which is defined precisely in Section \ref{sec_setup}.
\textit{Our first contribution} is to develop a concentration bound that arises naturally from the bias-variance tradeoff of $\hat{\beta}_t^{\MTL}$ for two tasks.
%Let $\hat{\beta}_t^{\STL}$ denote the single-task estimator.
%Without loss of generality, let the $t$-th task denote the target task.
%Importantly, the target task's data size is a fixed constant times $p$ in the high-dimensional setting.
%Hence adding more labeled data can help improve its test performance.

%We revisit the bias-variance tradeoff of the multi-task estimator.
%Interestingly, we observe that the variance of the multi-task estimator is always smaller than the variance of the single-task estimator, hence resulting in a positive effect of variance reduction.
%The bias of the multi-task estimator results in a negative effect caused by the difference between $\beta_t$ and the rest of $\set{\beta_i}_{i=1}^{t-1}$.
%Hence, the bias-variance tradeoff determines whether we observe positive or negative transfer.


\begin{theorem}[Informal]\label{lem_cov_shift_informal}
	In the setting of two tasks, let $a_1, a_2$ be fixed values solved from deterministic equations of $\rho_1, \rho_2$ and the spectrum of $\Sigma_1^{1/2}\Sigma_2^{-1}\Sigma_1^{1/2}$.
	%let $M = \Sigma_1^{1/2}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}$ and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_p$ be the singular values of $M^{\top}M$ in descending order.
	For any constant $\e>0$, w.h.p. over the randomness of $X_1, X_2$, we have that
	\begin{align}\label{eq_introX1X2}
		\bigtr{(X_1^{\top}X_1 + X_2^{\top}X_2)^{-1}\Sigma_2} = \frac{1}{\rho_1+\rho_2}\cdot \frac1p\bigtr{ (a_1 \Sigma_1 + a_2\Sigma_2)^{-1} \Sigma_2} +\bigo{{p^{-1/2+\epsilon}}}.
	\end{align}
\end{theorem}

%Concretely, we show a tight bound on the trace of $(X_1^{\top}X_1 + X_2^{\top}X_2)^{-1}$, which
Theorem \ref{lem_cov_shift_informal} extends a well-known result for the single-task setting when $X_1, \rho_1, a_1 = 0$ \cite{S07}.
The concentration error of our result, which is on the order of $O(p^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$, is nearly optimal.
%We shall assume that each task data follows a linear model, i.e. $y_i = X_i \beta_i + \varepsilon_i$, $1\le i\le k$.
%Here $\beta_i\in\real^p$ is the model parameter for the $i$-th task.
%Each row of $X_i\in\real^{n_i\times p}$ is assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from a fixed
%distribution with covariance matrix $\Sigma_i$.
Based on Theorem \ref{lem_cov_shift_informal}, we provide an analysis of the bias-variance tradeoff of $\hat{\beta}_t^{\MTL}$ for two settings:
(i) two tasks with general covariance matrice; (ii) many tasks with the same features (e.g. images).
%We extend our result to the transfer learning
%in the setting of high-dimensional linear regression.
%by pooling source task representations into the shared body of the hard parameter sharing architecture, following
%setting of Taskonomy by Zamir et al. \cite{ZSSGM18}.
%We prove that the bias of the transfer learning estimator is given by the projection of $\beta_t$ to the orthogonal subspace spanned by $\set{\beta_i}_{i=1}^{t-1}$.
%These results are described more precisely in Section \ref{sec_main}.

\textit{Our next contribution} is to use our newly developed tool to explain negative transfer in multi-task learning precisely.
In Section \ref{sec_insight}, we explain the three phenomena in Figure \ref{fig_model_shift_phasetrans} for a simplified isotropic setting of two tasks.
It is crucial that the concentration error of Theorem \ref{lem_cov_shift_informal} is $O(p^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$ so that we can explain the transition phenomena in Figure \ref{fig_model_shift} and \ref{fig_size}.
The unexplained observations are caused by an error term that arises from the bias of $\hat{\beta}_t^{\MTL}$ -- we discuss these in Section \ref{sec_insight} more precisely.
Theorem \ref{lem_cov_shift_informal} allows us to compare MTL performance under different covariate shift, measured by $M = \Sigma_1^{1/2}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}$.
When $\beta_1 = \beta_2$, we show that for a certain family of bounded $M$ matrices, having no covariate shift, i.e. all singular values of $M$ being equal, yields the optimal MTL performance.
%In Section \ref{sec_insight}, we consider three components including task similarity, data size and covariate shift for a simplified isotropic setting of two tasks.
%We measure task similarity by how small is the distance between $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$.
%Using our tool, we explain a transition from positive to negative transfer as task similarity decreases.
%		Furthermore, we show that negative transfer is more likely to occur when the source task labels are particularly noisy.
%		In Section \ref{sec_validate}, we validate the observation on text and image classification tasks.
%	In , we provide the trade-off between $\norm{\beta_1 - \beta_2}^2$ and a certain function $\Phi(\rho_1, \rho_2)$ to determine the type of transfer.
%We show that increasing the data size of the source task does not always improve performance for the target task in multi-task learning.
Finally, we analyze the benefit of MTL for reducing the amount of labeled data needed to achieve comparable performance to STL, which is a key empirical finding of Taskonomy.
%We show that covariate shift, measured by $\Sigma_1^{1/2}\Sigma_2^{-1/2}$, is another cause for suboptimal performance for $\hat{\beta}_t^{\MTL}$.
%		We show that as $n_1 / n_2$ becomes large, having no covariate shift between the source and target tasks yields the optimal performance for the target task.
%		On the other hand, when $n_1 / n_2$ is small, there are counter examples where having the same covariance matrix is not necessarily the optimal choice.

\textit{Our last contribution} is to connect our theory to practical problems of interest.
(i) We provide a single-task based metric to predict positive or negative transfer in multi-task learning.
While it is not well understood when multi-task learning provides positive transfer, we show that the STL results can help indicate and understand MTL results on ChestX-ray14 \cite{chexnet17} and sentiment analysis datasets \cite{LZWDA18}.
(ii) We design an incremental training schedule to improve the efficiency of multi-task training for predicting a particular task.
We show that our training schedule reduces the computational cost by $55\%$ compared to baseline multi-task training on the sentiment analysis dataset, while keeping the accuracy the same.
(iii) We validate the three components of our theory in Section \ref{sec_insight} and measure the data efficiency of multi-task learning on the sentiment analysis dataset.
